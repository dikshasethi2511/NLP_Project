# NLP_Project
This is the project we made for our NLP course in IIIT-Delhi.

The project dealt with **classifying sentences as hateful, offensive, or neither**.

We implemented multiple **Transformer-based architectures** to achieve the results.

On the final dataset, we achieved a total accuracy of 77.52575% (approx 25% of the dataset was for private ranking and 75% was for public ranking in Kaggle)
